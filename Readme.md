Discount Calculator
This is a Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The program only applies a discount if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.

Features
Takes user input for price and discount percentage. Applies the discount only if it is 20% or more. Returns the final price after calculation.

How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter price of the item and discount percentage
2. If the discount is less than 20%, no discount is applied.
3. If the discount is 20% or more, the discount is applied to the price.
4. The final price is displayed.
